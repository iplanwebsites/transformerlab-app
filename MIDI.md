# MIDI Model Support for TransformerLab

This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for adding MIDI model support to TransformerLab.

## Overview

TransformerLab currently supports text and multimodal image models. Adding MIDI support will allow users to work with music generation models like MusicGen, MusicLM, and AudioLDM, enabling:

- Input and output of MIDI files
- Visualization of musical notation
- Audio playback of generated music
- Fine-tuning of music generation models

## Implementation Requirements

- [ ] Add MIDI model architectures to model types registry:
  - [ ] MusicGen
  - [ ] MusicLM
  - [ ] AudioLDM
  - [ ] Other audio generation architectures
- [ ] Update model detection logic to identify MIDI-capable models
- [ ] Create appropriate model configuration panels for MIDI models

### 2. UI Components

- [ ] MIDI File Input:
  - [ ] Create MIDISubmit component for uploading MIDI files
  - [ ] Add file dialog with MIDI file filtering
  - [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for MIDI files
  - [ ] Support URL-based MIDI input
- [ ] MIDI Visualization:
  - [ ] Add notation display component (using VexFlow or similar)
  - [ ] Create piano roll visualization
  - [ ] Implement timeline view for MIDI sequences
- [ ] MIDI Playback:
  - [ ] Add audio playback controls
  - [ ] Implement real-time playback with visualization
  - [ ] Add tempo/speed controls

### 3. Data Processing

- [ ] MIDI File Handling:
  - [ ] Add parsers for MIDI files

- [ ] Data Preprocessing:
  - [ ] Implement MIDI tokenization for model inputs
  - [ ] Create data augmentation for MIDI training sets
  - [ ] Add batch processing utilities for MIDI files

### 4. API Enhancements

- [ ] Extend API SDK for MIDI support:
  - [ ] Add MIDI-specific endpoints
  - [ ] Implement MIDI message formatting for models
  - [ ] Create streaming support for MIDI generation
- [ ] Backend Integration:
  - [ ] Add MIDI file type detection
  - [ ] Implement proper encoding/decoding for MIDI data
  - [ ] Create caching mechanisms for MIDI resources

### 5. Model Inference

- [ ] Inference Engine Support:
  - [ ] Update existing engines to support MIDI models
  - [ ] Add configuration options for MIDI generation
  - [ ] Implement model-specific parameters (tempo, instrument, etc.)
- [ ] Output Processing:
  - [ ] Add post-processing for generated MIDI
  - [ ] Implement quality controls for musical outputs
  - [ ] Create export options for different MIDI formats

### 6. Training Capabilities

- [ ] MIDI Dataset Handling:
  - [ ] Create MIDI dataset import utilities
  - [ ] Implement dataset preview for MIDI files
  - [ ] Add metadata extraction for music datasets
- [ ] Fine-tuning:
  - [ ] Implement LoRA for music generation models
